# Rock Paper Scissors Game
In this fun little game of Rock Paper Scissors you can see an except of my vanilla JavaScript skills. The game can be played against the computer, where the player chooses their move and the computer randomly selects its move.

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Select how many rounds you want to play.
3. Make your first move by clicking on the corresponding button (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) to start the game.
4. The computer will randomly select its move.
5. The game will determine the winner based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors and display the result on the screen.

## Notes
- There are no points given for draws, but it still counts as a turn. For example, a 5 round game with 4 draws will only have 1 point in total.
- This page is not yet optimized for mobile devices. Also, it was developed on a 1440px x 735px screen. If your screen is significantly larger than that the page will probably not look very aligned.
